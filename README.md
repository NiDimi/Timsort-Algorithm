A algorithms coursework during my first year in the university, which is basically the Timsort algorithm (derived from
merge sort and insertion sort) written in Python

## Complexity
| Best Cases        | Average Case| Worst Case  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| O(n)     | O(n log n) | O(n log n) |
